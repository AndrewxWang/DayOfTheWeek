# DayOfTheWeek
My school has a day of the week system (A-F Days), so I tried to create something that automatically changes the day. The days will not change on weekends, but you have to manually add dates to special holidays, etc.

Notice:
do NOT delete 'day.txt'

if you want to change the day manually, go inside day.txt and edit the number:
0: Day A
1: Day B
2: Day C
3: Day D
4: Day E
5: Day F

otherwise, you can use the next and previous buttons when you run the file.
